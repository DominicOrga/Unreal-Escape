Unreal Escape is a prototype Unreal Engine project made mostly with C++ and some blueprints. 

Its purpose is to test and demonstrate the rudimentary relationship between C++ and blueprint coding, such as creating events within c++ and make it accessible within blueprints, while allowing blueprint to initialize the properties of a c++ object, and etc.

The prototype exhibits object transferring and opening doors based on the sum of the all the object's mass placed on a specified trigger volume.
